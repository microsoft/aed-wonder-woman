1984 is bold, grand, and electric. It’s an era of excess and corruption, and in [WONDER WOMAN 1984](https://www.wonderwomanfilm.com/) it's the year Wonder Woman must harness the power of technology to restore balance to the world. And Microsoft is partnering with the film to empower coders and creators of all ages to learn technology skills they can use for greater good.

The modules in this learning path invite you to learn to code through the lens of an inspiring movie and exciting plot. Learn how to setup your development environment using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/) on Windows, Linuz, or Mac and write your first few lines of Python. With your new coding super power, you will write a program to help Woner Woman decode secret messages and figure out what super power you have by building a quiz. 

Learning to code doesn't have to always be about adding numbers and sorting arbitrary lists, so why not learn the basics with the power of the DC Universe?

This learning path is part of Microsoft's [WONDER WOMAN 1984 learn to code lessons](https://www.microsoft.com/inculture/wonderwoman-1984/). There you will also find a Code Hunt challenge that sends you across the internet to find clues and a video game design challenge launching October 2nd, 2020.
