# Summary of the Wonder Woman Codehunt Challenge

So...did you find it? Were you able to complete all 5 of the Codehunt missions and discover the truth about Wonder Woman's missing gear?

If so, then you have already started your coding journey with a Wonder Woman flare!

In Mission 1, you learned how to [convert a binary sequence to ASCII characters](https://www.bing.com/search?q=binary+to+text+converter&qs=SC&pq=binary+to+text+coner&sc=8-20&cvid=4F01F15EE0D540698C86EF6B95AFD7C7&FORM=QBLH&sp=1). 

In Mission 2, you probably took a Wonder Woman Quiz that you found on Bing.com to find a code word.

In Mission 3, you converted a jpg to a web format to find a secret bit of information embedded in the file.

In Mission 4, you learned how to [decode a secret message using the oldest known cipher; the Ceaser Cipher](https://learninglab.si.edu/collections/decode-a-secret-message/y4f5099n4wjraemz#r/857650).

And, in Mission 5, you learned how to [decode a secret message using a Base64 decoder](https://www.bing.com/search?q=base64+decoder&form=QBLH&sp=-1&ghc=1&pq=base64+decode&sc=8-13&qs=n&sk=&cvid=05DE789842EB40C5B979BB6CF29F31E6). 

In Mission 2 you took a quiz on your knowledge of Wonder Woman, but if you're anything like me, you might also like taking personality quizzes that inform you what super power you would have. In the [Create a Quiz to Determine Your Super Power with Python and Visual Studio Code]() Learn module you will get to create your very own quiz using Python. Customize it and have your friends take it. You'll get a chance to learn about conditional statements in Python while having a bit of fun!

Throughout these missions you also used three different decoders: Binary to ASCII, Ceasar Cipher, and a Base64 decoder. The Binary and Base64 converters have conventient tools on the web, but when it came to the Ceasar Cipher you probably decoded the message by hand on paper. In the [Decode Secret Messages for Wonder Woman with Python and Visual Studio Code]() Learn module you will get a chance to create a program that will decipher future messages using the Ceaser Cipher so that you no longer have to do it by hand. 

That's the beauty of learning to code, you can be creative and build ways to entertain yourself and your friends and automate tasks that have clear rules. With the first steps of Python under your belt, you will be able to continue your journey to help restore balance in our world towards good instead of evil. 

After you complete this learning path, you can find other Learn modules to inspire your next steps on our [Student page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/roles/student). From [tracking global air quality with Azure Maps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/azure-maps-track-air-pollution/) to [helping remote farmets protect their crops with text message weather alerts using Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/send-crop-weather-alerts/) we are here to guide you through new tech, new coding skills, and engaging problems to solve!
