# What's Next in the World of Decoding Messages?

With your decrypt.py file you now have the ability to decode any secrete message that uses the English alphabet. Your decoded messages will be in all lower case, but that shouldn't take away from the meaning behind it!

Special thanks to [Audrey St. John from Mount Holyoke College](https://www.mtholyoke.edu/people/audrey-stjohn) for the inspiration for this lesson! 

## Additional Challenges for your Decrypt Code

As an added challenge, you can start exploring how you might:
- Maintain casing for each letter throughout the decoding process
- Create a function that reads in an entire message without having to print each word individually
- Modify your decoder to include numbers

## Discovering your Super Powers

With the location and time of the next super hero meeting decoded, it's now time to figure out which super hero you really are! In the next module in this learning path you will [create a quiz to determine Your super power with Python and Visual Studio Code]().
