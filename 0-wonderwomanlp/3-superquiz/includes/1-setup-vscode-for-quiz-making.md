Let’s start by creating a folder on your computer where you can find easily it. Call it “WW84”—I created mine in my Documents folder.

_**Note:** If you already followed the previous lesson where you decoded a secret message, you can use the same folder as before._

Then open Visual Studio Code and select "Open folder..." from the start screen; open your WW84 folder.

Let's create a file called "quiz.py".

Feel free to close the Welcome tab now.

_**Note:** As you are coding in Python, Visual Studio Code will suggest other powers to add to Visual Studio Code, such as "Linters". You don't need these for this project, so feel free to ignore them._


The first thing we’ll do is make sure our command center works. We’ll give a simple command that tells the Python to print us a message. Copy the following command into your file:
```python
print( "Hello, Themyscira!" )
```

To have the Python follow your commands, press the green Play button in the upper right corner. You should see a message from the Python below.
