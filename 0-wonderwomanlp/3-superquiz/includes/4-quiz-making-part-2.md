Okay, let’s put all our questions in. Replace the commands in your script with the following. For now, we’ll just print out the responses to make sure everything is hooked up correctly.
```python
# ask the candidate a question
weapon = input( "Which weapon?\n(A) Lasso\n(B) No weapon, thank you\n" )

# ask the candidate a second question
job = input( "What’s your dream job?\n(A) Curator at the Smithsonian\n(B) Running a business\n" )

# ask the candidate a third question
value = input( "What’s more important?\n(A) Money\n(B) Love\n" )

# ask the candidate a fourth question
decade = input( "What’s your favorite decade?\n(A) 1910s\n(B) 1980s\n" )

# ask the candidate a fifth question
animal = input( "What’s your favorite big cat?\n(A) Tiger\n(B) Cheetah\n" )

# print out their choices
print( f"You chose {weapon}, then {job}, then {value}, then {decade}, then {animal}.")
```
Press the Play button and make sure your responses are recorded correctly.
